    "reasoning": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of additional bridges required so that a tourist can traverse all bridges exactly once.\n\nThis problem can be translated into a graph theory problem, specifically an Eulerian path problem. In an Eulerian path problem, a path exists if and only if exactly zero or two vertices have an odd degree. If more than two vertices have an odd degree, we need to add edges (bridges) to reduce the number of vertices with odd degrees to zero or two.\n\nFrom the description, we can interpret the map as a graph where:\n- The two banks and four islands are vertices.\n- The eight bridges are edges connecting these vertices.\n\nLet's count the degree of each vertex:\n- Left bank: connected to 3 bridges (degree 3)\n- Right bank: connected to 3 bridges (degree 3)\n- First island: connected to 2 bridges (degree 2)\n- Second island (above): connected to 2 bridges (degree 2)\n- Third island (below): connected to 2 bridges (degree 2)\n- Fourth island: connected to 3 bridges (degree 3)\n\nWe have four vertices with an odd degree (Left bank, Right bank, and Fourth island). To make an Eulerian path possible, we need to add enough bridges to reduce the number of vertices with an odd degree to zero or two. This can be achieved by adding one bridge between any two vertices with odd degrees.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of bridges that need to be built is 1.",

However, `i--` decrements `i`, making it -1, -2, -3, etc., which will never satisfy `i < n` again after the first iteration.\n\nLet's analyze the modifications:\n\n1. Replacing `n = 3` with `n = -3`: This will make the loop condition `i < n` false immediately, so no output.\n2. Replacing `int i = 0` with `long i = 0`: This does not change the loop behavior.\n3. Replacing `i < n` with `-i < n`: This changes the condition to check if the negative of `i` is less than `n`. Initially, `-i` is 0, which is less than 3. Then `i` becomes -1, -2, -3, and the condition holds true for the first three iterations.\n4. Replacing `i < n` with `i + n`: This is not a valid condition for a loop.\n5. Replacing `i--` with `n--`: This decrements `n`, making the loop run 3 times.\n6. Replacing `cout << '$'` with `cout << \"$$$\"`: This prints `$$$` in one iteration, not three separate iterations.\n\nThe correct modifications are 3, 5, and 6.\n",

    "reasoning": "To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming to count the number of ways to reach each cell from the starting cell (0,0). We create a 2D array to store the number of ways to reach each cell. We initialize the starting cell (0,0) with 1 way to be there. Then, we iterate through each cell and update the number of ways to reach it based on the possible moves from the cells above and to the left.\n\nThe transitions are as follows:\n- From cell (i, j), Ioan can move to (i+1, j), (i+2, j), (i, j+1), or (i, j+2).\n\nWe use these transitions to update the number of ways to reach each cell until we fill the entire matrix up to cell (20, 24).",
