On the other hand, the date `23.05.2021 20:53` is not robust, because the set `{5, 20, 23, 53, 2021}` can also identify other dates (for example, `20.05.2021 23:53`).\n\nHow many dates between `01.01.2021 00:00` and `31.12.2021 23:59` (inclusive) are robust?\n\nA date is valid if the hour is in the interval `[0, 23]`, the minute in `[0, 59]`, the month in `[1, 12]`, the day in the interval corresponding to that month according to the 2021 year calendar.\n",
